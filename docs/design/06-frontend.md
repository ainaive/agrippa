# 06 — Frontend Architecture

> Status: living document · Last updated: 2026-07-17

`apps/web`: Vite + React SPA. Routing: **TanStack Router** (code-first route tree in `src/router.tsx`, type-safe params). Data: **TanStack Query**. UI: **shadcn/ui** on Tailwind v4 (`@tailwindcss/vite` plugin + `@/` path alias; components vendored into `src/components/ui/`, exempted from strict lint via a scoped biome override). Visual identity: indigo/violet primary over cool-tinted neutrals, defined as OKLCH tokens in `src/index.css` (light + dark), plus semantic `status-*` tokens for run/step states. Icons: lucide-react.

## App shell (GitLab-style)

The chrome is a persistent **left sidebar** + slim **top bar** (`SidebarProvider` → `AppSidebar` + `SidebarInset`):

- **Sidebar** (`components/shell/AppSidebar.tsx`, collapsible to an icon rail; renders as a sheet drawer on mobile): brand mark, then the **project context switcher** (command palette popover: search, archived badges, "New project" dialog), then grouped navigation — *Project* (Dashboard / Catalog / Tasks / Settings, role-gated), *Organization* (Approvals, Admin for org admins). While on org-level pages the project group stays visible, bound to the last-visited project (persisted as `agrippa.lastProject`).
- **Top bar** (`components/shell/Topbar.tsx`): sidebar trigger, **breadcrumbs** derived from route `staticData.crumb` (i18n keys, with `$project` / `$run` resolving to live names), and the **user menu** — avatar dropdown with language (en / zh-CN, persists to localStorage + `PATCH /me`) and theme (light / dark / system via `features/theme.tsx`) plus sign out.
- Mutation feedback is toast-based (sonner `Toaster` mounted in the shell); destructive actions confirm via `ConfirmDialog`.

## The Auto-Generated Task Form (core contract)

`GET /task-types/:id` returns the compiled template `inputs` array — a self-describing schema. A single renderer turns it into a working, localized, validated form:

```
<TaskParamsForm schema={inputs} onSubmit={...} />
```

- Widget mapping: `string`→Input, `text`→Textarea, `number`→NumberInput, `boolean`→Switch, `select`→Select, `repoRef`→picker over the project's repo connections, `docRef`→document picker.
- Labels/help from the schema's `{en, zh-CN}` objects via `pickLocale`.
- A zod validator is derived client-side from the same schema; the API re-validates server-side from the identical compiled schema — the two can't drift.

This is the contract that makes "add a task type without frontend work" true: publishing a new template version with different inputs changes the form with zero SPA changes.

## Live Run Detail

`GET /runs/:id` embeds a **viewer-scoped projection of the pinned template plan** (`template: { slug, version, phases[{id, name, stepIds, approval}], budgets, modelRoles }` — structure and i18n names only, never step instructions or prompts), and `GET /runs/:id/steps` aggregates per-step spend from `token_usage` into each row's `usage`. On top of that, `useRunEvents(runId)` opens the SSE stream (`/runs/:id/events`, browser `EventSource` handles `Last-Event-ID` reconnection) and invalidates the run queries (debounced) as events arrive; the run also polls at 3–5 s while non-terminal as a fallback.

The page (`pages/RunDetailPage.tsx` composing `features/runs/*`):

- **PhaseTimeline** — steps grouped under the template's phases (numbered, localized names; unstarted phases dimmed; runs without an embed fall back to grouping by `phaseId`), each step with status icon, duration, cost, attempt count, and its model-role chip; approval checkpoints render inline in their phase with their decision state.
- **BudgetMeter** — cost vs. `maxCostUsd` and elapsed vs. `maxDurationMinutes` as progress meters (danger tint past 90%), plus per-phase caps.
- **RunMetaCard** — pinned `slug@vN`, executor, and the frozen model resolution (role → provider model + tier).
- **Streaming pane** — `message.delta` events accumulate into the output tab; step outputs are the fallback once the stream ends.
- **Activity tab** (`features/runs/RunActivityFeed.tsx`) — the run's tool calls (error-tinted when the tool errored), subagent spawns, workspace checkout, step transitions, and approval requests, rebuilt from the SSE event stream.
- **Artifact previews** (`components/artifacts/ArtifactPreview.tsx`) — markdown rendered inline (react-markdown + GFM, styled by the `.markdown-body` component layer), patches colorized by the hand-rolled `PatchView`, JSON pretty-printed, links clickable; anything over 256 KB (or of kind `file`) is download-only.
- **ApprovalPanel** (`features/runs/ApprovalPanel.tsx`) — renders the checkpoint's `present:` artifacts inline with previews, plus Approve/Reject + comment with toast feedback; shared with the approvals inbox.
- Cancel while running; retry (navigates to the new pinned run) once terminal.

`useRunEvents` keeps one `EventSource` per run for the run's whole lifetime: the run status is read through a ref, not the effect deps, so status transitions don't tear down the stream (recreating it wiped accumulated activity mid-run); terminal `run.*` events still close it.

## Screens

1. **Project dashboard** — stat tiles (active runs, pending approvals with an inbox link, spend with a quota progress meter, totals), recent-tasks card, spend-by-model panel.
2. **Scenario catalog** — scenario sections × task-type cards (localized names/descriptions, Faber avatar chips), searchable across both locales' text.
3. **Task submission** — auto-generated form beside a sticky summary card (Faber, pinned template version, budgets) with the submit action; errors toast.
4. **Run detail** — see "Live Run Detail" above.
5. **Approvals inbox** — `GET /approvals/pending`, grouped by project; rows expand into the shared ApprovalPanel with presented-artifact previews and inline decide (viewers get read-only rows); sidebar badge carries the live count.
6. **Resource admin** — per-resource pages (`pages/admin/`) with a shared dialog-form pattern: fabri / models / skills+versions / MCP servers, full create/edit, disable-without-delete, write-only masked secrets with an explicit clear affordance.
7. **Template editor** — monospace YAML textarea (CodeMirror deliberately out of scope for now), `validate` (dry-run compile with inline errors), rendered **form preview** from compiled inputs, version browser (open any version; edits fork into the next draft), client-side diff between any two versions (`diff` + the shared PatchView), publish and deprecate with confirmation.
8. **Project settings** — vertical section nav: General (rename/description + archive danger zone), members & roles, resource grants (toggle matrix per resource type), repos, quota; destructive actions confirm.
9. **Usage** — per-project page: spend vs. quota, total tokens, daily-spend SVG bars, byModel/byTaskType proportion bars (all from `GET /projects/:id/usage`).
10. **Audit log** — org-admin page over `GET /audit-logs`: actor/action/resource rows with project + action filters and expandable payloads.

## i18n in the SPA

react-i18next; static import of both locales from `@agrippa/i18n` (two locales — no lazy-loading complexity). Locale switcher in the shell persists to localStorage and `PATCH /me`; switch is instant (no reload). DB-driven strings (scenario/task-type names, template labels) arrive as `{en, zh-CN}` objects and go through the shared `pickLocale` helper. See [07-i18n](07-i18n.md).
